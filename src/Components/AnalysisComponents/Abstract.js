                Samples of a tuyere from southern Africa have been tested to determine if the vitrified glass would be a strong magnetic recorder. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter, alternative gradient field magnetometer (AGFM) tests, and first order reversal curves (FORCs) were used to investigate the samples’ compositions and magnetic properties. The samples were found to contain iron oxide crystals in a silica glass matrix, as well as what appeared to be the beginning stages of dendritic iron oxide crystals. Based on the tests, these samples have been found to be good magnetic indicators of mixed-domain composition, and the iron oxide more likely to be magnetite than hematite.
