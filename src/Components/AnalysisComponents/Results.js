            Our investigation focused on three areas, one with mostly light amber glass, one with a medium brown glass, and one with darker brown glass. In the amber section, no chemistry was taken, but a backscatter image revealed flecks of high-density grains within the matrix, similar to the other areas tested. In the medium brown glass, a cluster of high-density, star-shaped grains were found (Fig. 3A, C, E)and their chemistry had high peaks for oxygen, aluminum, iron, silicon, and smaller peaks at calcium, magnesium, and titanium (Fig. 3H). The surrounding glass, by comparison, had much smaller peaks of iron and aluminum and was mostly silicon and oxygen (Fig. 3J). In the dark brown glass (Fig. 3B), chemistry of the glass itself revealed peaks at silicon, oxygen, aluminum, and a small peak at iron (Fig. 3I). Also in this area, a grain was found that displayed characteristics of the beginning/formational stages of a dendrite (Fig. 3D, F). The grainâ€™s chemistry had high peaks at oxygen and iron, with smaller peaks at aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and titanium, and had little silicon (Fig. 3K).
