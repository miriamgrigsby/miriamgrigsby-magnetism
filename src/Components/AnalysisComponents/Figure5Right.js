            Once we had a stronger understanding of how the iron-oxide dendrites may have formed, we looked into different structures and types of dendrites. Magnetite seems to be less well studied when it comes to classifying dendritic shapes. The octapod shape was the only concrete name we found directly referencing magnetite. Hematite, on the other hand, had a wide variety of dendrite shapes ranging from pine structures, flowers, to snowflake-like structures (Cao et al., 2005). The pine tree structure seems closely related to some of the dendrites we observed in our glass. The long dendrites show same crystal growth in every direction, and the crystallographic nature of dendrites.

            Shape is just one distinguishing factor of dendrite classification. There is also a distinction between thermal and saturation dendrites. Thermal dendrites are described as crystals whose growth is controlled primarily by the diffusion of heat and are rate dependent. Saturation dendrites are crystals whose growth is controlled by the diffusion of fresh material to growth fronts (Keith et al., 1962). Dendrites growing in a pure metal are thermal dendrites, whereas snowflakes are saturation dendrites. The distinction between these two types of dendrites is determined by the growth mechanism: heat vs. matter. Diffusion processes of each play a major role in the growth of any given dendrite. The Keith paper only furthers the idea that the formation of iron-oxide dendrites is rate dependent because our dendrites would be classified as thermal dendrites.
