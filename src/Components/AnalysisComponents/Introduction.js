            During the African Iron age, local tribes used smelting furnaces connected to long tubes known as tuyere in their iron making process. The tuyere pipes were made of a clay-like substance that when heated over time, formed a vitrified glass. Because the villages were located within the region of Africa thatâ€™s part of the South Atlantic Anomaly, the tuyere samples are of magnetic interest.

            Glass has been shown to retain magnetic information in numerous other studies. Previous studies of vitrified glass from the Limpopo River Valley investigated vesicle rich glass found in kraals which are mixtures of cattle dung, grass, and wood (Tarduno et. al., 2015). The kraals and tuyere were both collected as in situ samples. The tuyere are an extension of the work previously done on glass samples from the Limpopo River valley. Samples are dated in several ways, namely archeology. There is a system of pottery styles used for dating through symbols and patterns.
