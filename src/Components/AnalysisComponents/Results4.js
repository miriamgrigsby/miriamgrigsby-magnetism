            The kappabridge measures samples and plots the data points onto a susceptibility vs. temperature graph. Kappabridge also measures magnetic anisotropy. The sample is cooled in the presence of a field and then heated past the curie temperature. Specific slope changes at certain temperatures indicate different types of minerals present as the sample loses or gains magnetization. Different susceptibilities are measured as the sample is placed into 15 different positions. It is important for the heating and cooling curves to match as closely as possible. Our graph indicates that we are not dealing with a purely magnetite sample and that it is more likely titanomagnetite. Hematite is also present in our samples, which makes sense due to the red color of the mud that forms the tuyere.
