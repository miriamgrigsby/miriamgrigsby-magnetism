            The iron and oxygen present in the grains from both the knob and the tube suggest that the grains are composed of an iron-oxide, most likely magnetite with some pigmentary hematite. However, the presence of titanium in some of the grains supports the kappabridge data in suggesting that the samples are not purely magnetite but rather titanomagnetite. The titanium in the sample would lower its Curie temperature from 580 degrees to a surprisingly wide range between room temperature and around 560 degrees. Because we notice some anisotropy and the presence of titanium, we conclude that the tuyere is not an ideal magnetic recorder.
