                        Further, the presence of dendrites in man-made glass has been documented in several papers on fly-ash. Fly-ash particles are microscopic, spherical particles formed during the firing of coal (Sokol et al., 2002). The particles can be either hollow or solid, but in both cases have been mostly found to be made of skeletal dendritic structures (Kutchko & Kim 2006, Ramsden & Shibaoka 1982, Sokol et al. 2002). In the paper by Sokol et al., it was determined that this dendritic structure is the result of rapid cooling.

                        Dendrites form in snowflakes, metals, ash, and synthetics. From the literature review, we believe that dendrites, especially iron-oxides, are dependent on growth rate, anisotropy, and impurities regardless of what material they form in. We found no specific evidence for the stages on iron-oxide dendrite formation. Flipping through the chapters of the “Oxide Minerals” book, we found a chapter written by Haggerty. The chapter contained images of titanomagnetite grains that were the closest match to what we were seeing in our tuyere glass. These images coupled with the chemistry we took of the dendrites and platelets leads us to believe we are dealing with titanomagnetite grains rather than true magnetite.
