            From the knob and tube,  samples were taken and crushed for AGFM (Alternating Gradient Field Magnetometer) analysis (Fig. 2). Five hysteresis loops were collected from the knob and seven from the tube. We used information from the hysteresis data to locate the data point on a Day plot for each of the crush pieces. The hysteresis loops were used to tell how good of a magnetic recorder the glass was, while the Day plots can suggest what crystal domains exist within the material. Hysteresis loops can produce ambiguous results due to factors such as magnetic interactions, mineral composition, and grain size. Day plots have a similar problem. They plot ratios of Mrs/Ms (saturation remanent magnetization/saturation magnetization) vs. Hcr/Hc (coercivity or remanence/coercivity force) and bulk magnetic properties.

            One of the crush pieces was also used to produce a FORC (First Order Reversal Curve) to better determine the composition of the iron oxide in the glass. These kinds of measurements are used to provide more detailed information about the sample. Distinct features such as thermal relaxation and domain state variations show up prominently in FORCs. FORC measurements are collected by first saturating the sample in a positive field, Ha. The field is then decreased to a reversal field, Hr. The FORC curve is the magnetization curve that results as the applied field is cranked back up to saturation. FORC data is then transformed into a FORC contour plot for further analysis.
