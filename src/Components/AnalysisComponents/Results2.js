            In the second sample, a backscatter image revealed a region with a lighter swirl through the darker matrix (Fig. 4A, B). When the composition of the matrix (Fig. 4E) was compared to that of the swirl (fig. 4F), they were found to be highly similar but with the swirl containing more iron and less silicon than the surrounding glass. Two grains from this area were also investigated, one a spindle (Fig. 4C) and one a collection of blobs (Fig. 4D). The chemistry of the blobby grain was not taken, but the spindle had peaks of oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, and a few small peaks of magnesium and calcium (Fig. 4G).

            After our initial examination under the SEM, we felt there needed to be further investigation of the dendrites. The matrix is composed of silica glass with a mixture of iron-oxide platelets and dendrites. Platelets is a term used to describe the blob like structures we are observing (Harizanova et al., 2011). In her work, Harizanova found that the platelets were mainly ferromagnetic, while the dendrites were paramagnetic. Our AGFM data also shows evidence of paramagnetic behavior.

            In order to better understand the iron-oxide dendrites we were observing, we conducted a literature search. We focused on the formation of iron-oxide dendrites and in what substances they are formed. Iron-oxide dendrites are formed within rapidly cooling melts that are saturated with respect to iron (Shaar, Feinberg, 2013). These dendrites often possess strong shape anisotropy, and therefore magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic anisotropy is the directional dependence of a material's magnetic properties. This means magnetic moment will tend to align with the easy axis or energetically favorable direction. Irregular shaped particles such as octapod magnetite, pure magnetite with inverse spinel structure, have strong shape anisotropy (Zhao et al 2013, Yu et al 2011). Spherical grains show no shape anisotropy (Tarling et al., 1993). Anisotropy can affect how good a grain is as a magnetic recorder. For example, when testing a grain with the AGFM, you may have to rotate the sample on the holder until the magnetization is strong enough to create a hysteresis loop. One paper puts forward that shape anisotropy can affect magnetic properties by increasing the coercivity (Tadic et al., 2011).

            Anisotropy is only one important component of iron-oxide dendrites. Reaction time was a common factor in several papers from the literature review. Zhao reported that reaction time controlled the size of the dendrites. The dendrite morphologies may also be affected by reaction time (Yu et al, 2011).  Yu worked with octahedral magnetites and noted that after a specific time period, namely 6 hours, the rectangular platelet structure, thought to be hematite, disappeared. Another paper also suggests that crystallization conditions and cooling rate impact the crystal shapes (Isobe et al., 2013). It is therefore possible that cooling rate could affect shape anisotropy and consequently the magnetic anisotropy. Other components may also affect dendrite growth such as the presence of NaCl or absence of KOH. It is important to also note the effect that impurities play in the formation of dendrites. Impurities can play an important role in determining the growth rate or reaction time (Berg et al., 1937).
